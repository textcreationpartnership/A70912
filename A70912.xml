            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And now his Majeſties Commiſſioner, <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Traquaire,</hi> inſtructed and authorized with a full Commiſſion, being preſent and ſitting in this aſſembly, now fully conveened and orderly conſtitute in all the members thereof: according to the order of this Kirk, having at large declared His Majeſties zeal to the reformed Religion, and His Royall care and tender affection to this Kirk, where His Majeſtie had both His Birth and Baptiſme, His great diſpleaſure at the manifold diſtractions and diviſions of this Kirk and Kingdom, and His deſires to have all our wounds perfectly cured with a faire and fatherly hand; And although in the way approven by this Kirk, tryall hath been taken in former Aſſemblies before, from the Kirk Regiſters, to our full ſatisfaction, yet the Commiſſioners Grace making particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inquirie from the members of the Aſſembly, now ſolemnly convee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, concerning the reall and true cauſes of ſo many and great evills, at this time paſt, had ſo ſore troubled the peace of this Kirk and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, IT was repreſented to His Majeſties Commiſſioner, by this Aſſembly, that, beſide many other, the main and moſt materiall cauſes were, firſt the preſſing of this Kirk by the prelates, with a Service book or book of Common prayer, without warrant or direction from the Kirk, and containing, beſide the popiſh frame thereof, divers popiſh errours and ceremonies, and the ſeeds of manifold and groſſe ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and idolatrie; With a book of Canons, without warrant or dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the Generall Aſſembly, eſtabliſhing a tyrannicall power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Kirk, in the perſons of the Biſhops, and overthrowing the whole Diſcipline and Government of the Kirk by Aſſemblies; With a book of Conſecration and Ordination, without warrant of authoritie Civill or Eccleſiaſticall, appointing offices in the houſe of God, which are not warranted by the word of God, and repugnant to the Diſcipline and Acts of our Kirk; And with the High Commiſſion, erected without the conſent of this Kirk, ſubverting the juriſdiction and ordinary Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories of this Kirk, and giving to perſons meerly Eccleſiaſticall, the power of both ſwords, and to perſons meerly civill, the power of the keyes and kirk cenſures. A ſecond cauſe was the Articles of <hi>Perth, viz.</hi> the obſervation of Feſtivall dayes, kneeling at the Communion, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, Adminiſtration of the Sacraments in private places, which were brought in by a null Aſſembly, and are contrary to the Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Faith, as it was meant and ſubſcribed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1580. and diverſe times ſince, and to the order and conſtitution of this Kirk. Thirdly, the change of the Government of the Kirk, from the Aſſemblies of the Kirk, to the perſons of ſome Kirkmen, uſurping priority and power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Brethren, by the way, and under the name of Epiſcopall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, againſt the confeſſion of Faith, 1580. againſt the order ſet down in the book of policie, and againſt the intention and conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Kirk from the beginning. Fourthly, the civill places and power of Kirkmen, their ſitting in Seſſion, Councell, and Exchequer, their ryding, ſitting, and voycing in Parliament, and their ſitting in the Bench as Juſtices of Peace, which according to the Conſtitutions of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31909:5"/>this Kirk, are incompatible with their ſpirituall function, lift them up above their Brethren in worldly pomp, and doe tend to the hinderance of the Miniſterie. Fiftly, the keeping and authorizing corrupt Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies at <hi>Linlithgow</hi> 1606. 1608. at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> 1610. at <hi>Aberdene</hi> 1616. at <hi>S.

A ſixth cauſe is, the want of lawfull and Free Generall Aſſemblies, rightly conſtitute of Paſtours, Doctours, and Elders, yearely, or oftner, <hi>pro re nata,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Liberty of this Kirk, expreſſed in the book of policie, and acknowledged in the Act of Parliament 1592. after which, the whole Aſſembly, in one heart and voyce, did declare, that theſe and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, proceeding from the neglect and breach of the Nationall Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of this Kirk and Kingdome, made <hi>anno</hi> 1580. have been indeed the true &amp; main cauſes of all our evils and diſtractions, AND therefore or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, according to the Conſtitutions of the Generall Aſſemblies of this Kirk, and upon the grounds <hi>reſpective</hi> above-ſpecified, That the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Service-book, books of Canons, and Ordination, and the High Commiſſion, be ſtill rejected, That the articles of <hi>Pearth</hi> be no more practiſed, That Epiſcopall government, the civill places and power of Kirkmen, bee holden ſtill as unlawfull in this Kirk, That the above-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med pretented aſſemblies at <hi>Linlithgow</hi> 1606. 1608. at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> 1610. at <hi>Aberdene</hi> 1616. at <hi>S.

                  <p>IN OBEDIENCE to the commandement of God, conform to the practiſe of the godly in former times, and according to the laudable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our Worthy and Religious Progenitors, and of many yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving amongſt us, which was warranted alſo by Act of Councell, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding a generall Band to bee made and ſubſcribed by his Majeſties Subjects, of all ranks, for two cauſes: One was, for defending the true Religion, as it was then reformed, and is expreſſed in the Confeſſion of Faith, above-written, and a former large Confeſſion eſtabliſhed by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry acts of lawfull General Aſſemblies, and of Parliament, unto which it hath relation ſet down in publick Catechiſmes, and which had beene for many yeares with a bleſſing from Heaven preached, and profeſſed in this Kirk and kingdom, as GODS undoubted Truth, grounded onely upon his written Word. The other cauſe was, for maintaining the Kings Majeſtie, his Perſon, and Eſtate, the true worſhip of GOD,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:31909:11"/>and the Kings authority being ſo ſtraitly joyned, as that they had the ſame friends, and common enemies, and did ſtand and fall together. And finally, being convinced in our minds, and confeſſing with our mouths that the preſent and ſucceeding generations in this Land, are bound to keep the foreſaid Nationall Oath and Subſcription inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Wee Noblemen, Barons, Gentlemen, Burgeſſes, Miniſters, and Commons under-ſcribing, conſidering divers times before, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at this time, the danger of the true reformed Religion, of the Kings honour, and of the publick peace of the Kingdome, by the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold innovations and evils generally contained, and particularly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in our late ſupplications, complaints, and proteſtations, doe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by profeſſe, and before GOD, his Angels, and the world, ſolemnly declare, that with our whole hearts wee agree and reſolve all the dayes of our life conſtantly to adhere unto, &amp; to defend the foreſaid true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and (forbearing the practiſe of all novations, already introduced in the matters of the worſhip of GOD, or approbation of the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the publick government of the Kirk or civill places and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Kirkmen, till they be tryed and allowed in free aſſemblies, and in Parliaments) to labour by all meanes lawfull to recover the purity and liberty of the Goſpel, as it was eſtabliſhed and profeſſed before the foreſaid novations: And becauſe after due examination, wee plainely perceive, and undoubtedly beleeve, that the innovations and evills con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in our Supplications, Complaints, and Proteſtations have no warrant of the word of GOD, are contrary to the articles of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Confeſſions, to the intention and meaning of the bleſſed reformers of Religion in this Land, to the above-written acts of Parliament, and doe ſenſibly tend to the re-eſtabliſhing of the Popiſh religion and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and to the ſubverſion and ruine of the true reformed religion, and of our liberties, lawes and eſtates, Wee alſo declare that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid confeſſions are to be interpreted, and ought to be underſtood of the foreſaid novations and evills no leſſe than if every one of them had been expreſſed in the foreſaid confeſſions, and that wee are obliged to deteſt and abhorre them amongſt other particular heads of Papiſtry abjured therein. And therefore from the knowledge and conſciences of our duty to GOD, to our King and Countrey, without any worldly reſpect or inducement, ſo farre as humane infirmity will ſuffer, wiſhing a further meaſure of the grace of GOD for this effect; Wee promiſe, and ſweare by the <hi>Great Name of the Lord our GOD,</hi> to continue in the Profeſſion and obedience of the foreſaid Religion, That wee ſhall defend the ſame and reſiſt all theſe contrary errours and corruptions, according to our vocation, and to the uttermoſt of that power that GOD hath put in our hands, all the dayes of our life. And in like manner with the ſame heart, wee declare before GOD and Men, that wee have no intention nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to attempt any thing that may turn to the diſhonour of GOD, or to the diminution of the Kings greatneſſe and authority: But on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, wee promiſe and ſweare, that wee ſhall, to the uttermoſt of our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, with our meanes and lives, ſtand to the defence of our dread Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne the Kings Majeſtie, his Perſon, and Authority, in the defence and preſervation of the foreſaid true Religion, Liberties and Lawes of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:31909:11"/>Kingdome: As alſo to the mutuall defence and aſſiſtance, every one of us of another, in the ſame cauſe of maintaining the true Religion, and his Majeſties authority, with our beſt counſell, our bodies, meanes, and whole power againſt all ſorts of perſons whatſoever; So that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall be done to the leaſt of us for that cauſe, ſhall be taken as done to us all in generall, and to every one of us in particular. And that wee ſhall neither directly nor indirectly ſuffer our ſelves to be divided or withdrawn by whatſoever ſuggeſtion, allurement, or terrour from this bleſſed and loyall Conjunction, nor ſhall caſt in any let or impediment, that may ſtay or hinder any ſuch reſolution as by common conſent ſhall be found to conduce for ſo good ends. But on the contrary, ſhall by all lawfull meanes labour to further and promove the ſame. And if any ſuch dangerous and diviſive motion be made to us by word or writ, wee, and every one of us, ſhall either ſuppreſſe it, or, if need bee, ſhall incontinent make the ſame known, that it may be timouſly obviated. Neither doe wee fear the foul aſperſions of rebellion, combination, or what elſe our adverſaries from their craft and malice would put upon us, ſeeing what wee doe is ſo well warranted, and ariſeth from an unfained deſire to maintain the true worſhip of God, the Majeſty of our King, and peace of the Kingdome, for the common happineſſe of our ſelves, and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. And becauſe wee cannot look for a bleſſing from God upon our proceedings, except with our profeſſion and ſubſcription wee joyne ſuch a life and converſation as beſeemeth Chriſtians, who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed their Covenant with God; Wee therefore faithfully promiſe, for our ſelves, our followers, and all others under us, both in publike, in our particular families, and perſonall carriage, to endeavour to keepe our ſelves within the bounds of Chriſtian libertie, and to be good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to others of all Godlineſſe, Soberneſſe, and Righteouſneſſe, and of every duty wee owe to God and Man. And that this our Union and Conjunction may bee obſerved without violation, Wee call the living GOD, the Searcher of our Hearts, to witneſſe, who knoweth this to be our ſincere Deſire, and unfained Reſolution, as wee ſhall anſwer to JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS CHRIST, in the great Day, and under the pain of GODS ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting wrath, and of infamie, and loſſe of all honour and reſpect in this World, Moſt humbly beſeeching the Lord, to ſtrengthen us by his holy Spirit for this end, and to bleſſe our deſires and proceedings with a happy ſucceſſe, that Religion and Righteouſneſſe may flouriſh in the Land, to the glory of GOD, the honour of our King, and peace and comfort of us all.

                  <p>WHEREUNTO it is anſwered and agreed, That for as much as the Kings Majeſty, at the humble deſire of his Subjects, did call and conveen a <hi>Parliament</hi> to be holden at <hi>Edinburgh</hi> the 2. of <hi>June,</hi> 1640. wherein certain Acts were made and agreed upon, which Acts his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie (for the peace and good of his Kingdome) is pleaſed to publiſh in his owne name with conſent of the Eſtates, and therefore commands that the ſaid Acts bearing date the 11. day of <hi>June,</hi> 1640. be publiſhed with the Acts to be made in the next Seſſion of the ſame <hi>Parliament:</hi> and that all the ſaid Acts, aſwell of the precedent as of the next Seſſion, to be holden, have in all time comming the ſtrength of Lawes, and to be univerſally received, and obeyed by all the Subjects of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Majeſty doth in the word of a King promiſe the publiſhing of the ſaid Acts in ſuch ſort as is above ſpecified.</p>
                  <p>As for the manner of publiſhing the ſaid Acts, his Majeſty approves that the Declaration of the Eſtates in the beginning of the Acts, and the concluſion at the end, may be paſt in ſilence at the publiſhing of the Acts, and left out in the printed Copies: And if any thing ſhall further occurre concerning the manner of publiſhing the ſaid Acts, his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Commiſſioner may then offer it to the Eſtates to be conſidered of, his Majeſty being moſt aſſured that the Eſtates of <hi>Parliament</hi> will have a great care not to ſuffer his Majeſties authority to be prejudiced in the managing of theſe great affaires. <hi>Tertio Decembris,</hi> 1640.</p>
                  <p>THE SECOND DEMAND, that the Caſtle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and other ſtrengths of the Kingdome ſhould, with the advice of the Eſtates of <hi>Parliament,</hi> according to their firſt foundation be furniſhed, and uſed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:31909:39"/>for defence and ſecurity of the Kingdome. IS AGREED UNTO.</p>

                  <p>It is thereto anſwered and agreed in his Majeſties name, upon <hi>Decemb.</hi> 8. 1640. That as his Majeſty hath granted your firſt and ſecond De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, ſo doe we in his Majeſties name anſwer to the third: That all theſe who in his Majeſties Dominions of England or Ireland have been impriſoned, forfeited, or cenſured any other way for ſubſcribing of the Covenant, or for refuſing to take any other Oath contrary to the ſame, ſhall be freed of theſe cenſures, and ſhall be fully reſtored to their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, Eſtates, and Poſſeſſions. And for time comming, that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Scotland, as Subjects of Scotland, ſhall not be conſtrained to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny oath contrary to the Lawes of that Kingdome, and the Religion there eſtabliſhed: but ſuch of the Kingdome of Scotland as ſhall tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port themſelves into the Kingdome of England or Ireland, and there be ſetled Inhabitants, either by way of having inheritance or free-hold, or by way of ſetled Trades (by which the way of trading of the Factors of Merchants, nor of Merchants themſelves is not to be underſtood) ſhall be ſubject to the Lawes of England or Ireland, and to the oathes eſtabliſhed by the Lawes, and Acts of Parliament in the ſaid King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes reſpectively, wherein they live, and have their ordinary and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant reſidence, and not otherwayes. And the Engliſh and Iriſh ſhall have the like Priviledge in Scotland, 8. <hi>Decembris.</hi> 1640.</p>
                  <p>To the fourth Demand, craving that his Majeſty may be graciouſly pleaſed to declare, as an Act of <hi>Royall Juſtice,</hi> ſerving much to his owne Honour, for the eſtabliſhing of his Throne, and for the good and Peace of both Kingdomes, That whoſoever ſhall be found upon <hi>Tryall</hi> and <hi>Examination</hi> by the Eſtates of either of the two <hi>Parliaments</hi> (they judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the Perſons ſubject to their owne <hi>Authority</hi>) to have been the Authors and Cauſers of the late and preſent troubles and combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether by labouring to make, and forment Diviſion betwixt the King and his People, or betwixt the two Nations, or any other way, ſhall be liable to the Cenſure and Sentence of the ſaid Parliaments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, Conforme to the Paper of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 9. 1640.</p>
                  <p>It is anſwered, upon the 11. of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1640. That his Majeſty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth he hath none ſuch about him; And therefore concerning that point, he can make no other Declaration, then that he is juſt, and that all his Courts of Juſtice are free and open to all men. His Parliament in this Kingdome is now ſitting, and the current Parliament of Scotland neere approaching the time of their meeting, To either of which, hee doth not prohibite any of his Subjects to preſent their juſt grievances, and complaints, of whatſoever nature, each medling, and judging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Perſons, ſubject to their own Authority. 11. <hi>Decembris</hi> 1640.</p>
                  <p>It is further anſwered upon the ſaid 11. of <hi>December,</hi> 1640. To your fourth Demand, Concerning Incendiaries, that his Majeſty beleeveth, he hath none ſuch about him: Therefore, concerning that point, he can
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:31909:40"/>make no other Declaration, then that he is juſt, and that all his Courts of Juſtice are to bee free and open to all men. His Parliament in this Kingdome is now ſitting, and the current Parliament of Scotland neere approaching the time of their meeting; in either of which <hi>reſpective,</hi> he doth not prohibite the Eſtates to proceed in trying and judging what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever of his Subjects.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it was further demanded, that as his Majeſty would not hinder any of his Subjects to be tried and judged by the Parliament: ſo that none after the Sentence of the Parliament ſhould have acceſſe to his Majeſty, or be maintained, and enjoy Places or Offices, and have cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit or authority to informe and adviſe his Majeſty, Conforme to the Paper of <hi>December</hi> 23. 1640.</p>
                  <p>It is declared in his Majeſties name, upon <hi>December</hi> 30. 1640. Beſides his Majeſties former Anſwers, His Majeſty hath commanded us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in his Name, That he will not imploy any Perſon or Perſons in Office or Place that ſhal be judged incapable by ſentence of Parliament: Nor wil he make uſe of their ſervice without the conſent of Parliament, nor grant them acceſſe to his Perſon, whereby they may interrupt, or diſturbe that firme Peace, which he now ſo much deſireth, he being confident that they will proceed in a faire &amp; juſt way, and (according to their ſeverall profeſſions) with that reſpect to his honour, which in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he may expect from good and dutiful Subjects: 30. of <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1640.</p>
                  <p>The fifth Demand, That their ſhips and goods, and all Dammage thereof may be reſtored.</p>

                  <p>And further, the Parliament upon the 3. of <hi>February</hi> did declare, that they did conceive, that the ſumme of three hundred thouſand pounds is a fit proportion for the friendly aſſiſtance, and relief formerly thought fit to be given towards ſupply of the loſſes, and neceſſities of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that the Houſe would in due time take into conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration the manner how, and the time when the ſame ſhall be raiſed, Conforme to the Paper of the 3. of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1641. <hi>Stilo Scotico,</hi> and given in to the Treaty upon the 5. of the ſaid Moneth.</p>

                  <p>It is anſwered and reſolved by the Parliament, That theſe Earles, Lords and Commiſſioners following, ſhall be the perſons to whom the Scots ſhall addreſſe themſelves for the receiving of the ſummes at the dayes appointed by the Parliament; Earl of <hi>Bedford,</hi> Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> Earle of <hi>Warwick,</hi> Earle of <hi>Holland,</hi> Earle of <hi>Stanford,</hi> Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> Lord <hi>Mandevill,</hi> Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> Mr. <hi>Martin,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Barrington,</hi> Mr. <hi>Capell,</hi> Sir <hi>Ar.

                  </p>
                  <p>It is anſwered upon the 10. of <hi>February</hi> 1641. <hi>Stilo Scotico.</hi> We do agree, that all declarations, proclamations, acts, books, libels, and pamphlets that have been made, &amp; publiſhed againſt the loyalty &amp; dutifulneſſe of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties ſubjects of Scotland, ſhal be recalled, ſuppreſſed, &amp; forbidden in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland &amp; Ireland. And that this be reciprocall in Scotland, if any ſuch have bin made, or publiſhed there in prejudice of his Majeſties honour: And this upon diligent inquiry to be done by the authority of the Parliament next ſitting in Scotland, of which the Commiſſioners of Scotland doe promiſe to have an eſpecial care: And we do alſo agree, that when it ſhall pleaſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God to grant a happy cloſe of this Treaty of Peace, the loyalty of his Majeſties ſaid Subjects ſhall be made known at the time of publick thankſgiving in all places, &amp; particularly in the Pariſh Churches of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Dominions.

                  <p>We do firſt of all deſire, that all monuments, tokens, &amp; ſhews of hoſtility upon the borders of the two kingdoms may be taken away, &amp; that upon the reaſons &amp; conſiderations particularly expreſt in the paper, of the 10. of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1641. <hi>ſtilo ſcotico.</hi> That not only the Garriſons of Barwick, and Carlile may be removed, but that the works may be ſlighted, and the places diſmantled.</p>
                  <p>It is anſwered, and agreed upon the 14. of <hi>June,</hi> That his Majeſty is deſirous, that all things betwixt the Kingdomes of Scotland and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:31909:41"/>bee reduced into the ſame ſtate they were in, before the beginning of the late troubles.</p>
                  <p>And therefore Hee doth give his Aſſent to the advice of the two Houſes of Parliament, that the Garriſons of <hi>Barwicke</hi> and <hi>Carlile,</hi> upon the disbanding of the Scottiſh Army now in <hi>England,</hi> and of all ſuch Forces as are gathered together in <hi>Scotland,</hi> be likewiſe preſently remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: And that the Fortifications of <hi>Barwick</hi> and <hi>Carlile</hi> bee alſo redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the ſame condition they were before the late troubles. So that all Fortifications in <hi>Scotland</hi> bee likewiſe put in the ſame condition they were before the ſaid troubles; And that the Workes bee not repaired, but ſuffered to decay, and that the Ordinance, and Ammunition bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: And that it bee without prejudice to his Majeſties former grant of the ſecond Demand, Concerning the keeping of the Caſtles of the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> 14. of <hi>June,</hi> 1641.</p>
                  <p>To their deſire concerning unity in Religion, &amp; uniformity of Church-government, as a ſpeciall meanes for conſerving of Peace betwixt the two Kingdoms, upon the grounds and reaſons contained in the Paper of the 10. of <hi>March</hi> given into the treaty and Parliament of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is anſwered, upon the 15. of <hi>June,</hi> That his Majeſty, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of both Houſes of Parliament, doth approve of the affection of his Subjects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in their deſire of having Conformity of Church-government betweene the two Nations, and as the Parliament hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken into conſideration the Reformation of church government, ſo they wil proceed therin in due time, as ſhal beſt conduce to the glory of God, the peace of the Church, &amp; of both Kingdoms; 11. of <hi>June</hi> 1641.</p>
                  <p>To their deſire of the Kings Majeſty, and the Prince their comming, and reſiding ſome times in <hi>Scotland,</hi> upon the reaſons given in, <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> 16. 1641. <hi>Stilo Scotico.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is anſwered upon the 9. of <hi>June,</hi> that his Majeſty doth take in good part the ſenſe his Subjects of <hi>Scotland</hi> have of his abſence, and the duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full expreſſion they make of their deſire to have Him, and the Prince his Sonne frequently among them; and aſſuring himſelfe that they have no other intention in this Demand, but meerely to expreſſe their love to his Perſon, and the welfare of his ancient Kingdome, He declares unto them, that as he ſhall finde the urgency of thoſe affaires require his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and his other conveniences here permit, He will repaire thither, and the Prince his Sonne, ſo farre as he may know and be acquainted with the People there, 9. of <hi>June</hi> 1641.</p>
                  <p>To the deſire concerning the manner of chooſing and placing of the officers of State, Counſellors, and Seſſioners, within the Kingdome of <hi>Scotland</hi> by advice of the Parliament, upon the grounds and reaſons given in, <hi>March</hi> 15. 1641. <hi>Stilo Scotico.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is anſwered the 9. of <hi>June,</hi> in his Majeſties name; We intend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more heartily, and really then that our People ſhall be governed by the Laws of the Kingdome, and that all Judges in their ſeverall Judicatories ſhould judge accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we wil never allow nor permit, that either Counſellors, offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of State, or Judges be exeemed from our, &amp; our Parliaments tryall and cenſure, for the diſcharging of their duties in their ſeverall offices,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:31909:42"/>and places; Likewiſe we conceive that nothing will more conduce to the good of our ſervice, and the peaceable and happy government of the Kingdome, then that officers of State, places of Councell and Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and other Judicatories be provided with honeſt, able, and qualified men. For which end, and becauſe of our neceſſary abſence from that Kingdom, which maketh the qualification of Perſons fit for places leſſe known to us, We ſhal ſo far give eare to the Informations of our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and when our Parliament is not ſitting, of our Councell, and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Juſtice, as that we ſhal make choiſe of ſome one of ſuch, as they by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon conſent upon the vacancie of the place ſhal recommend unto us: Or if wee ſhall conceive another perſon to bee fitter then any of theſe recommended, wee ſhall make the ſame knowne to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or in the time betweene Parliament, to out Councell and Seſſion, that from them wee may be informed of the Qualification and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the perſon named by us, to the effect, that if by their Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſhall appeare to us, that there is juſt exception againſt the life, and qualification of the ſaid party, wee may timely nominate ſome other, againſt whom there ſhall bee no juſt exception.</p>
                  <p>By which meanes wee doubt not, but that wee ſhall from time to time chooſe ſuch honeſt men, as for their knowne Integrities and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities ſhall bee fit to diſcharge their places, and Offices, with that duty and ſufficiency which wee and our Subjects may juſtly expect.</p>
                  <p>Which intention of ours being now ſo cleerely and fully expreſſed, wee doubt not, but will give good ſatisfaction to our enſuing Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>And as wee never intended to remove juſt and able men from their places in the Colledge of Juſtice: So doe wee now declare for our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples full ſatisfaction, that their places ſhall provided unto them, <hi>Quam diu ſe bene geſſerint.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if this our Anſwer cannot content the Scottiſh Commiſſioners, Wee doe then remit the whole Anſwer to be conſidered by us, or our Commiſſioner, and the Parliament, at the next ſitting thereof, 9. of <hi>June,</hi> 1641.</p>
                  <p>To their deſire of placing ſome Scottiſh men of reſpect about the King; and Queenes Majeſties, and the Princes Highneſſe, upon the grounds and reaſons given in the 9. of <hi>Aprill,</hi> 1641.</p>
                  <p>It is anſwered, His Majeſties goodneſſe, and grace towards his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Scotland</hi> in placing them about his owne Perſon, in places of greateſt neereneſſe and truſt, hath beene ſuch, as ought to give them full ſatisfaction of His Royall Affection towards His Subjects of His Native Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, for this point, His Majeſtie needeth onely to aſſure them that hee ſhall continue the ſame care, which hitherto hee hath done for their ſatisfaction in this particular: and not onely ſo, but ſhall alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the ſame to the Prince his Sonne, that ſucceſſively the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhall ſo taſte of the care of their Soveraignes, That by the Grace of God, they ſhall never want a ſufficient number of honeſt, and ſufficient perſons of that Nation about the Kings Perſon and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:31909:42"/>againſt whom there ſhall be no juſt exception, the 9. of <hi>June,</hi> 1641.</p>
                  <p>To their deſire that none may have place about his Majeſty, and the Prince, but ſuch as are of the <hi>reformed Religion,</hi> in manner expreſſed in the paper. 1. <hi>April</hi> 1641.</p>
                  <p>It is anſwered, His Majeſty doth conceive, that his Subjects of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have no intention by this propoſition, (eſpecially by way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand) to limit, or preſcribe unto him the choice of his Servants, but rather to ſhew their zeal to Religion, wherein his owne piety will make him do therein that which may give juſt ſatisfaction to his people, 9. <hi>June</hi> 1641.</p>
                  <p>To their deſire given in the firſt of <hi>April,</hi> concerning the Copper Coine.</p>
                  <p>It is anſwered, Whereas the Scottiſh Commiſſioners have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto his Majeſty, the great prejudice ſuſtained by the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> through the coining of Copper money, which hath paſſed there this long time by-gone, for ſeven times and above as much as the true value and worth thereof, contrary to the continuall cuſtome of that Kingdome, And therefore deſiring that no Copper money bee coined hereafter, without conſent of the Eſtates conveened in Parliament, who may remedy the preſent prejudices the Country ſuſtains thereby: And who upon good conſideration of the neceſſity thereof in time to come, may appoint ſuch a competent proportion as is fit, and as the Countrey ſhall require for the uſe of the poore, and for change in buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſelling of commodities, and that the ſame ſhall not paſſe, but according to the intrinſick value thereof, with the allowance of a tenth part or ſuch a proportion as the Parliament ſhall think fit to allow for the impreſſion, and workmanſhip in coyning. His Majeſty is graciouſly pleaſed to recommend to the enſuing Parliament of <hi>Scotland</hi> the whole matter of copper coine, and remits to their conſideration to take ſuch order therein as they ſhall thinke fitting, not onely concerning the cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per coine to be coyned hereafter, but alſo the copper money already coyned, how the ſame ſhall take vent, and paſſe in payment in time comming, Conforme to the paper of the ninth of <hi>June,</hi> 1641.</p>
